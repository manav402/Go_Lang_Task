## PROBLEM :-
 - using found knowledge of html css create a user registration form
 - and create a styled table shown in task document

## APPROACH
 1. for user registration page we can use display flex to justify the content
 2. using offsets in table to stayle the thead and tr tag of the table

## NOTES 
 > table has seperate css styling from other tag and thead,tbody or tr tag are 
 > are just for grouping for related data that can't be styled as regular
 > html elements so we have to use special html properties or use
 > td tag to style the table
