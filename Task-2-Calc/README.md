### PROBLEM
  - Create a working basic calculator app using html css and vanilla js

### APPROACH
  - Using eval function from js to evaluate the string in js which we take from user input in html
  - Styling the calculator app with display flex and using event listener from js to tackle button clicks
  - Using Regex program to match the input string of user with valid input

### NOTE
  > The js and maybe every programming language store floating point with different precision 
  > And for the same some precision can't be stored as it is some round off to decimal digit are necessary
  > So some input value result in wrong or wrong precise answer
  > Tried to solve it
